# Top 5 security threats

1. Injection Attacks - When untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or a query
2. Broken Authentication - Often the authentication is broken and therefore a great opportunity for attackers to get password, tokens and more
3. Sensitive data Exposure - API don't protect properly senstive information therefore easily provide opportunity for identify theft and other bad information leaks
4. XML entities - Older and poorly written XML processors can be exploited with XML injection with hostile content
5. Broken Access control - Restriction on what user can access is often poorly implemented and allow other users to see sensitive data
